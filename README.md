# Pokedex

This Pokedex project offers two user interfaces for browsing Pokemon data. The first interface is built with HTML and CSS, providing a classic and straightforward way to view information about different Pokemon. The second interface, built with React, is more dynamic and interactive, with search functionality and the ability to filter Pokemon by type or region.

The second interface access real-time data from the PokeAPI, including information on Pokemon species, moves, abilities, and more. Additionally, users can save their favorite Pokemon and access them easily later on.

This Pokedex is easy to install and use, making it an ideal tool for Pokemon enthusiasts looking to explore the world of Pokemon in a fun and engaging way. If you're interested, check out my Github repository to get started!
